**Last Updated: January 5, 2026**

## Our Commitment to Privacy

Pinger is designed with privacy at its core. We believe your network monitoring data is yours alone.

## Data Collection

**We collect ZERO personal data.** Specifically:

- No account registration required
- No analytics or tracking
- No crash reporting with personal data
- No advertising networks
- No third-party SDKs

## Data Storage

All monitoring data is stored **exclusively on your device**:

- All ping history stays on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac
- No cloud synchronization
- No server uploads
- You control when to export or delete data

## Network Access

Pinger only accesses:

- The specific IP addresses or hostnames you configure for monitoring
- No other network connections are made
- No analytics servers, no update checks with tracking

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect your data, there's nothing to:

- Request access to
- Request deletion of
- Request correction of

Your data never leaves your device, so you have complete control.

## Changes to This Policy

If we ever change this privacy policy, we will update this page and the "Last Updated" date above.
