# Copilot Instructions for LFSite

## Project Overview
LFSite is a Jekyll-based multi-site hosting setup:
- **Root site**: Lone Fondness (a 3-player card game) - theme-based Jekyll at root
- **Pinger sub-site**: Product site for network monitoring app (iOS/macOS), fully custom HTML/CSS, located in `/pinger/`

Both sites are independently deployed to GitHub Pages with separate configurations.
